climin
------

CLIMIN is a Python package for optimization, heavily biased to machine learning
scenarios distributed under the BSD 3-clause license. It works on top of numpy
and (partially) gnumpy.

The project was started in winter 2011 by Christian Osendorfer and Justin Bayer.
Since then, Sarah Diot-Girard, Thomas Rueckstiess and Sebastian Urban have 
contributed. If you use climin in your (academic) work, please cite as
